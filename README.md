# Simple Scientific Calculator

A straightforward scientific calculator app, mirroring the functionality of the iPhone's built-in calculator, excluding bracket operations. The backend is developed in C# while the frontend utilizes XAML with the .NET MAUI framework. This app supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS.

## Features

- **Basic Math Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, cosine, and tangent calculations.
- **Advanced Operations**: Square, square root, power functions, and more.
- **User-Friendly Display**: Previous user inputs and mathematical operations are displayed for easy reference.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Enhanced user experience with an option for fullscreen mode.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation)
