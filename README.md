## Features

- **Basic Math Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, cosine, and tangent calculations.
- **Advanced Operations**: Square, square root, power functions, and more.
- **User-Friendly Display**: Previous user inputs and mathematical operations are displayed for easy reference.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Enhanced user experience with an option for fullscreen mode.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on Windows, Android, iOS, ipadOS and macOS.

## Screenshot below now showing the latest update as of 24th august 2025 using NET MAUI 9.0 and updating the UI drastically.
### Note that the app installed on my physical android device looks slightly different (it actually looks more like the macos version) on my physical android 15 phone compared to what you see here on the android 15 emulator deployed on jetbrains rider
